###Project 3

####Part 1.
Convert your project 2 list container class to be a template. Populate
at least two different objects of your container class each with a different
data type (i.e. same container class, different data types). Provide client code
that uses your project 3 function for both of these lists.

#####Note:
As long as the finished program meets the requirements of project 3 as a
template, you can modify your project 3 code in any way necessary, including
redesigning your original program (optional).

####Part 2.
Write an alternative program to meet the requirements for project 2
using the STL list template class instead. Your function should use an iterator
as the cursor for your list objects. As with part 1, you should demonstrate the
use of more than one data type.
